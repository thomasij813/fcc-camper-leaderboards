# Free Code Camp Camper Leaderboards

This project was built as part of Free Code Camp's JavaScript curriculum. It completes [this challenge](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-camper-leaderboard).

I also created a pen on CodePen [here](http://codepen.io/thomasij813/pen/qZZwqp?editors=1010).
